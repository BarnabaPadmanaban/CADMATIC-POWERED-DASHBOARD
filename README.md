# CADMATIC-POWERED-DASHBOARD
Smart Engineering Data Visualization with LLaMA-Driven Chatbot

The CADMATIC-Powered AI Dashboard is a production-grade web application developed as part of a 10-day internship at CADMATIC Solutions. It combines advanced data visualization with real-time, AI-powered insights tailored for engineering workflows.

Built with Python, Dash, and Plotly, the dashboard allows users to upload Excel datasets and auto-generate meaningful charts based on the data structure. The highlight of the system is a locally hosted chatbot powered by Ollama running LLaMA, enabling on-device, private, and context-aware responses — all without relying on external APIs.

🔧 Key Features:
📁 Drag-and-drop Excel file upload

📊 Auto-selection of chart types (bar, scatter, histogram, etc.)

🎛️ Manual axis and chart configuration

🤖 LLaMA-powered chatbot via Ollama for interpreting visualizations

🌐 Responsive, production-ready frontend with real-time interactivity

This system brings together the power of CAD tools, the clarity of intelligent visualization, and the autonomy of local AI inference, making it ideal for engineering and industrial use cases.
